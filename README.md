# 👨‍💻 Hello World, I’m a Programmer!

Hi there! I'm one of those mythical creatures you've heard about—the **developer** who can break production with a single line of code and fix it with two... maybe three... okay fine, after a lot of Googling.

## 🧠 Who Am I?

My name is McDonald. I’m a full-time software engineer, part-time Stack Overflow archaeologist, and weekend keyboard warrior who believes that semicolons are optional (unless the linter says otherwise).

Born somewhere between the `404` error and the `500 Internal Server Error`, I now reside at IP address `127.0.0.1`. My life philosophy?

> “If it compiles, ship it. If it doesn’t, blame the intern. If you *are* the intern... well, good luck.”

## 🛠️ My Tech Stack (aka, What I Break Most Often)

- **Languages I speak better than humans**: `JavaScript`, `Python`, `Go`, and occasionally `C++` when I’m feeling masochistic.
- **Front-End**: `React`, `Vue`, `CSS` (or as I call it, "Cursed Styling Sheets"). Yes, I use Tailwind now because I finally gave up on naming divs properly.
- **Back-End**: `Node.js` is my jam. I also flirt with `Flask` when Python seduces me with its indentation.
- **Databases**: I’m fluent in `MongoDB` and `MySQL`, but I have a toxic relationship with `PostgreSQL`. We argue a lot, but I keep coming back.
- **DevOps**: I can `dockerize` anything—even my cat (don’t ask). Kubernetes? I know just enough to be dangerous.
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure—I’ve used them all, and I still don’t know where my S3 bill comes from.

## 🐞 My Experience with Bugs

Some developers debug by reading logs. I debug by staring at the code until something breaks in my soul. I believe every bug tells a story—usually a horror story that ends with me yelling, “But it worked on my machine!”

Once, I spent 6 hours fixing a bug that turned out to be a missing comma. That day, I truly understood what it meant to be humbled by code.

## 🧃 Tools of the Trade

- **VS Code**: My soulmate. It finishes my sentences and occasionally crashes on me—just like a real relationship.
- **Terminal**: I speak fluent Bash. `cd ..`, `cd ..`, `cd ..`—the struggle is real.
- **Git**: My version control skills are top-notch. My commit history looks like:  
  ```
  git commit -m "final final really final version"
  git commit -m "fix typo"
  git commit -m "undo fix"
  ```
- **Stack Overflow**: Basically my second brain. Sometimes my first.

## ☕ My Daily Routine

1. Open laptop.
2. Close 47 Chrome tabs I left open yesterday.
3. Start coding.
4. Get distracted fixing a totally unrelated bug.
5. End up refactoring something no one asked me to touch.
6. Push to production, pray nothing breaks.
7. Check logs like a paranoid parent with a baby monitor.
8. Repeat.

## 🧩 Fun Facts About Me

- I drink more coffee than water. I consider that hydration.
- I once tried to explain recursion to my dog. He walked away, which is fair.
- I believe the best code is written at 2 AM with a hoodie on and lo-fi beats playing.
- I’ve Googled “how to center a div” more times than I’ve said “hello” to my neighbors.

## 🚀 My Career Goals

- Write code that doesn’t require a “README for the README.”
- Build an app that doesn’t need to be turned off and on again to work.
- One day, understand what the heck Kubernetes is actually doing.
- Maybe, just maybe, write a commit message that won’t embarrass me five years from now.

## 🧘 Philosophy of Coding

Programming isn’t just a job—it’s an emotional rollercoaster. One moment, you’re a genius who just solved a problem with one line of code. The next, you're sobbing in the corner because a semi-colon broke everything.

But that’s the magic of it. We build things from nothing but logic, coffee, and sheer stubbornness.

> “To iterate is human. To recurse, divine.”

## 📬 Let’s Connect!

If you want to talk about code, tech, life, or why tabs are better than spaces (fight me), feel free to reach out. I promise not to send you JSON in a text message. (Well... maybe just once.)

**P.S.** If you’ve read this far, congratulations—you’ve just passed the programmer’s ultimate test: **patience**. You’re hired.
